# How is the character of David developed in early Jewish literature?
## Chronicles/Ezra-Nehemiah: ca. 4th c. BC
## *Psalms of Solomon*: ca. 2nd c. BC
## Qumran: ca. 2nd c. BC--1st c. AD
## Philo of Alexandria: 1st c. AD
## Josephus and Pseudo-Philo: 1st c. AD

# Matthew V. Novenson: “\[N\]ot all Jewish leaders are messiahs, not all messiahs are royal, not all royal messiahs are Davidic, and not all Davidic messiahs are sons of David.”

<!--
* *The Grammar of Messianism: An Ancient Jewish Political Idiom and Its Users* (New York, N.Y.: Oxford University Press, 2016), 111.
* Although we aren't as concerned with messianism in this class, when we start considering David in the New Testament, we can't entirely avoid messianism either.
* A few things are worth saying:
  * There isn't one unified concept of "the messiah" in the Hebrew Bible or in early Jewish thought.
    * Even in the Hebrew Bible, there isn't a single stream of tradition about the messiah; various texts (Isaiah, for example) are used by different readers and communities to develop different ideas about the messiah or God's eschatological restoration of Israel, but The Messiah(tm) isn't a distinguishable character in biblical texts.
    * When, for example, Matthew portrays the scribes in Herod's court offering up their interpretation of "where the messiah would be born," a very specific understanding of the messiah is being assumed.
  * Davidic connections aren't always considered to be a prerequisite for messianic figures.
  * Messiah figures aren't always royal, e.g., the priestly messiah of Aaron at Qumran.

# Mark 12:35-37

While Jesus was teaching in the temple, he said, “How can the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David?
David himself, by the Holy Spirit, declared,\
&emsp;&emsp;‘The Lord said to my Lord,\
&emsp;&emsp;“Sit at my right hand,\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;until I put your enemies under your feet.”’\
David himself calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?”
And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.

# Psalm 110

The <sc>Lord</sc> says to my lord,\
“Sit at my right hand\
until I make your enemies your footstool.”\
The <sc>Lord</sc> sends out from Zion\
&emsp;your mighty scepter.\
&emsp;Rule in the midst of your foes\.\.\.\.\
The <sc>Lord</sc> has sworn and will not change his mind,\
“You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”\
The Lord is at your right hand;\
&emsp;he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath.\
He will execute judgment among the nations,\
&emsp;filling them with corpses\.\.\.\.\
He will drink from the stream by the path;\
&emsp;therefore he will lift up his head.
