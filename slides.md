# 11Q5 27.1--11: “David's Compositions”
\[David\] wrote psalms: three thousand six hundred\.\.\.\.

# Acts 4:24--25
\[They said\], “Sovereign Lord... it is you who said by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant: ‘Why did the Gentiles rage...?’”

# *Midr. Teh.* 1:2
As Moses gave five books of laws to Israel, so David gave five Books of Psalms to Israel.

<!--
* David and *the psalter* are both in flux in early Judaism/Second Temple period.
* Davidic association in the Psalms situates him as a character/prophetic voice, not primarily an author/composer.
-->

# David's voice in the Psalms is expanded from character and pious exemplar to composer and prophetic authority.

<!--
* Note that this expansion rarely takes the form of specific authorial attribution in the same way as Midr. Teh. 1:2.

# How is the character of David developed in early Jewish literature?
## Chronicles/Ezra-Nehemiah: ca. 4th c. BC
## *Psalms of Solomon*: ca. 2nd c. BC
## Qumran: ca. 2nd c. BC--1st c. AD
## Philo of Alexandria: 1st c. AD
## Josephus and Pseudo-Philo: 1st c. AD

<!--
* What are the unique contributions of various early Jewish texts to the understanding of David during this period?
* I won't attempt to exhaustively describe David in each text or to address all the various presentations of David in early Jewish literature, but reviewing a selection will give us a nice overview.

# 1 Chronicles 21:28--22:1
At that time, when David saw that the <sc>Lord</sc> had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he made his sacrifices there.
For the tabernacle of the <sc>Lord</sc>, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon\.\.\.\.
Then David said, “Here shall be the house of the <sc>Lord</sc> God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”

<!--
* Notably, David is modifying the location of Israel's altar.
* Of course, he's doing so in response to a divine sign of fire from heaven, but nevertheless, this constitutes a modification to the Mosaic order that is taking place largely at David's command.

# 1 Chronicles 23:25--32
\[David took a census of the Levites and organized their houses.\]
For David said, “The <sc>Lord</sc>, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he resides in Jerusalem forever.
And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service...
but their duty shall be to assist the descendants of Aaron for the service of the house of the <sc>Lord</sc>, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God.\.\.\.
And they shall stand every morning, thanking and praising the <sc>Lord</sc>, and likewise at evening, and whenever burnt offerings are offered to the <sc>Lord</sc> on sabbaths, new moons, and appointed festivals, according to the number required of them, regularly before the <sc>Lord</sc>.
Thus they shall keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and shall attend the descendants of Aaron, their kindred, for the service of the house of the <sc>Lord</sc>.”

<!--
* A few things are worth noting.
* First, the shift in the duties of the Levities is connected to the establishment of the divine presence in Jerusalem.
  * That is, whereas previously a mobile tabernacle was appropriate for God's presence with his people, now that Israel has been given rest and Jerusalem has become the permanent residence of the divine presence, the tabernacle duties must give way to something new.
  * The Levites were previously tasked with carrying the tabernale and its furnishings, but now they will assist the priests in the care of the temple.
* Second, these new duties also involve musical service.
  * The Levites are to stand every morning and evening, thanking and praising the Lord.
  * David isn't merely shifting around Israel's liturgical personnel; he's establishing new practices and making significant alterations to the previous liturgical order.
  * 1 Chronicles goes on to describe the various liturgical guilds that are formed to preserve the Levitical liturgical traditions going forward.

# 1 Chronicles 28:11--19
Then David gave his son Solomon the plan of the vestibule of the temple, and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat;
and the plan of all that he had \[by the Spirit\]\.\.\.\.
\[David then said to Solomon,\] “All this, in writing at the <sc>Lord</sc>’s direction, he made clear to me—the plan of all the works.”

<!--
* Many English translations have "all that he had in mind" in v. 12, but I opt for the more prophetically-tinged "by the Spirit" here (MT: ותבנית כל אשר היה ברוח עמו; LXX: ὃ εἶχεν
ἐν πνεύματι αὐτοῦ).
  * On this point, see Jürg Hutzli,“David in the Role of a Second Moses – The Revelation of the Temple-Model (Tabnît) in 1 Chronicles 28”, in *Chronicles and the Priestly Literature of the Hebrew Bible*, ed. Jaeyoung Jeon and Louis C. Jonker, *BZAW* 528 (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2021), 325–26.

# 2 Chronicles 34:1--3
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
He did what was right in the sight of the <sc>Lord</sc>, and walked in the ways of his ancestor David\.\.\.\.

# 2 Chronicles 35:1--3
Josiah kept a passover to the <sc>Lord</sc> in Jerusalem\.\.\.\.
He said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the <sc>Lord</sc>, “Make preparations by your ancestral houses by your divisions, following the written directions of King David of Israel and the written directions of his son Solomon\.\.\.\.
Slaughter the passover lamb, sanctify yourselves, and on behalf of your kindred make preparations, acting according to the word of the <sc>Lord</sc> by Moses.”

# 2 Chronicles 35:15
The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and the king’s seer Jeduthun.

# Nehemiah 12:24
And the leaders of the Levites... with their associates over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, section opposite to section.

# *Pss. Sol.* 17:23--51
See, O Lord, and raise up their king for them, a son of David, for the proper time that you see, God, to rule over Israel your servant. 
And undergird him with strength to shatter unrighteous rulers. 
Cleanse Jerusalem from the nations that trample it in destruction, to expel sinners from the inheritance in wisdom, in righteousness, to rub out the arrogance of the sinner like a potter’s vessel, to crush all their support with an iron rod\.\.\.\. 
And he will cleanse Jerusalem with sanctification, as also from the beginning, for nations to come from the edge of the earth to see his glory, bringing as gifts its utterly weakened sons, and to see the glory of the Lord that God glorified\.\.\.\. 
For he will not hope in horse and rider and bow, or multiply gold nor silver to himself for battle, and he will not gather hopes by many for the day of war. 
The Lord himself is his King, the hope of the one who is mighty by the hope of God, and he will show mercy to all the nations before him in fear\.\.\.\.
Blessed are those who live in those days, to see the good things of Israel in the gathering of tribes; may God do it. 
May God speed his mercy upon Israel; he will rescue us from the impurity of profane enemies. 
The Lord himself is our King forever and further. 

<!--
* This is one of the most descriptive messianic texts from the Second Temple period.
* This passage combines themes and motifs from several different biblical texts, including Jer 23, Isa 11, Psalm 2, and others.
  * We have the son of David smashing the evil rulers of the nations, like Psalm 2.
    * This makes sense in the context of the Hasmonean period, when the Psalms of Solomon were written.
  * We have the language of purification and cleansing from Ezekiel.
  * We have a righteous ruler, obeying the law of the king from Deuteronomy, whose own king is God himself.
  * All of this is connected to the regathering of Israel's tribes; the post-exilic restoration involves this son of David.
* Notably, none of the biblical passages alluded to contains all of the elements that are included here.
  * That is, you don't get the powerful king smashing the gentile rulers, the anointed purifier of Israel, and the wise ruler regathering the tribes all in one place in the Hebrew Bible.
  * We commonly associate these elements with *the Davidic messiah*, but this is the result of a confluence of scriptural traditions rather than a singular stream of thought from the Jewish scriptures.

# 4Q285 f. 7.1--6
\[… just as it is written in the book of\] Isaiah the prophet, “And \[the thickets of the forest\] shall be cut down \[with an ax, and Lebanon with its majestic trees wil\]l fall. A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse \[and a branch shall grow out of his roots” (Isa. 10:34–11:1).
This is the\] Branch of David. Then \[all forces of Belial\] shall be judged, \[and the king of the Kittim shall stand for judgment] and the Leader of the congregation—the Bra\[nch of David\]—will have him put to death.
\[Then all Israel shall come out with timbrel\]s and dancers, and the \[high\] priest shall order \[them to cleanse their bodies from the guilty blood of the c\]orpse\[s of\] the Kittim.

# 4Q174 2.18--3.13
This “place” is the house that \[they shall build for Him\] in the Last Days, as it is written in the book of \[Moses... (Exod. 15:17–18)\.\.\.\.
Strangers shall not again defile it, as they formerly defiled the Temp\[le of I\]srael through their sins.
To that end He has commanded that they build Him a Temple of Adam (or Temple of Humankind)\.\.\.\.
As for what He said to David, “I \[will give\] you \[rest\] from all your enemies” (2 Sam. 7:11b), this passage means that He will give them rest from \[al\]l the children of Belial, who cause them to stumble, seeking to destroy the\[m by means of\] their \[wickedness\].
They became party to the plan of Belial in order to cause the S\[ons\] of Li\[ght\] to stumble\.\.\.\.
“Moreover the <sc>Lord</sc> decl\[ares\] to you that He will make you a house,” and that “I will raise up your offspring after you, and establish the throne of his kingdom \[fore\]ver.
I will be a father to him, and he will be My son” (2 Sam. 7:11c, 12b, 13b–14a).
This passage refers to the Shoot of David, who is to arise with the Interpreter of the Law, and who will \[arise\] in Zi\[on in the La\]st Days, as it is written, “And I shall raise up the booth of David that is fallen” (Amos 9:11).
This passage describes the fallen Branch of David, \[w\]hom He shall raise up to deliver Israel.

# 11Q5 27.1--11: “David's Compositions”
And David, son of Jesse, was wise, and a light like the light of the sun, and learned,\
and discerning, and perfect in all his paths before God and men. And\
YHWH gave him a discerning and enlightened spirit. And he wrote psalms:\
three thousand six hundred; and songs to be sung before the altar over the perpetual\
offering of every day, for all the days of the year: three hundred\
and sixty-four; and for the sabbath offerings: fifty-two songs\.\.\.\.\
All these he spoke through the spirit of prophecy which had been given to him from before the Most High.

# CD 5.1--6
And concerning the prince it is said, **Let him not multiply wives to himself** (Deut 17:17).
But David had not read the sealed book of the Torah which was in the ark (of the Covenant), for it was not opened in Israel since the day of the death of Eleazar and Joshua and the elders who worshipped the Ashtoreth.
And what was (therein) revealed was hidden away until Zadok arose.
So the deeds of David were accepted—except for the murder of Uriah—for which God forgave him.

# 4QMMT<sup>c</sup> 25--32
Remember David, who was a man of the pious ones, [and] he, too, [was] freed from many afflictions and was forgiven.

# David in Philo of Alexandria...???

<!--
* David does not majorly figure into Philo's work.
* For Philo, Moses is the prototypical king, not David.
  * David is obliquely referred to as a student of Moses or "a prophetic man whom we do well to trust" in reference to a Psalm.
* But this demonstrates some of the diversity of early Jewish thought in the first century; David is not a central figure for everyone.

# Josephus, *Antiquities* 6.165--166
Then, taking the oil, with David looking on, \[Samouel\] smeared it on him and spoke softly in his ear, indicating that God had chosen him to rule as king\.\.\.\.
The Deity then abandoned Saoul and went over to David.
Once the divine spirit transferred to him, he began to prophesy.
A certain suffering beset Saoul and demons caused him to suffocate and choke\.\.\.\.

# Pseudo-Philo, *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* 59.3--5
Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring your son from the flock, for God has chosen him.”
Jesse sent and brought David, and Samuel anointed him in the midst of his brothers.
The Lord was with him from that day.
Then David undertook to sing this song, and he said, “From the ends of the earth I will give praise, and from the days of old I will extol.
When Abel at the beginning shepherded flocks, his sacrifice was more acceptable than his brother's, and his brother was jealous of him and killed him.
But for me it has not gone so, because God protected me and delivered me to his angels and to his guardians to protect me.
For my brothers were jealous of me, and my father and my mother abandoned me.
When the prophet came, they did not call to me\.\.\.\.
But God extended to me his right hand and his mercy.
Therefore I will not cease singing praises all the days of my life.”
While David was still speaking, behold a fierce lion from the forest and a bear from the mountain seized the oxen of David\.\.\.\.
David went out after them and took stones from the forest and killed them.
God said to him, “Behold, with stones I have delivered up these beasts for you.
This will be a sign for you that hereafter you will kill the enemy of my people with stones.”

# Pseudo-Philo, *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* 61.5--9
David set out, and he took seven stones and wrote on them the names of his fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses and Aaron, and his own name and that of the Lord.
God sent Zeruel, the angel in charge of power.

\[David taunts Goliath, etc.\]

David put a stone in the sling and struck the Philistine on his forehead.
He ran toward him and unsheathed his sword. Goliath, while he still had life in him, said to him, “Hurry and kill me, and rejoice.”
David said to him, “Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer who has killed you.”
The Philistine looked and saw the angel and said, “Not you alone killed me, but also he who was present with you, whose appearance is not like the appearance of a man.”
Then David cut off his head.
The angel of the Lord changed David's appearance, and no one recognized him.
When Saul saw David, he asked him who he was, and there was no one who recognized him.
